# Liri Node App

The Liri Node App allows users to access information about concerts, songs, and movies. Users input a band's name and receive information about upcoming shows. If they are interested in learning more about a specific song, they can input the song title and receive information about that song. Also, if there is a movie that sparks the user's interested, they can access a rich trove of information about nearly any movie.
