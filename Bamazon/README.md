# Bamazon

The Bamazon App in a CLI application that allows users to access a mock catalogue of products ranging from backpacks to coffee. Upon initialization, the user is presented with a brief note of welcome and an invitation to place an order for any of the listed products. A prompt below the listed product catalgue asks the user to indicate which product they would like to purchase by inputting the product ID that is listed alongside each item. After the user inputs the product ID, they are asked how many of said product they would like to buy. The application then checks the number of items ordered against the quantity in stock. If the order volume is less than the quantity in stock, the user is notified that their order has been successfully placed, otherwise they are notified that the application was unable to place their order.
